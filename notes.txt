https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/11989
My practical solution was to edit react-native source code at:
node-modules/react-native/Libraries/Components/Touchable/Touchable.js

Here I've changed "console.error" to "console.log" at line 628, this way I receive the message, however my app is not interrupted and the error is "dissmissed"
